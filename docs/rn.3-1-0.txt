v3.1.0 released 2019-09-10
===========================

New features and improvements

* :jirabug:`PT-1696`: the new ``pt-pg-summary`` tool supports PostgreSQL data
  collection in a way similar to other PT summary tools
* :jirabug:`PT-1663`: ``pt-stalk`` has two new options limiting the amount of
  disk space it can consume: ``--retention-size`` option makes ``pt-stalk`` to
  store less than the specified amount of megabytes, while ``--retention-count``
  option limits the number of runs for which data are kept
* :jirabug:`PT-1741`: Migration to a new MongoDB driver was done.
* :jirabug:`PT-1761`: ``pt-online-schema-change`` will not run under MySQL
  8.0.14 .. 8.0.17 if the table has foreign keys
  .. note:: There is an error in MySQL from versions 8.0.14 up to the current
     8.0.17 that makes MySQL die under certain conditions when trying to rename
     a table. Since the last step for pt-online-schema-change is to rename the
     tables to swap the old and new ones, we have added a check that prevents
     running ``pt-online-schema-change``Â if the conditions for this error are
     met.

Fixed bugs

* :jirabug:`PT-1114`: ``pt-table-checksum`` failed when the table was empty
* :jirabug:`PT-1344`: ``pt-online-schema-change`` failed to detect hostnames
  with a specified port number
* :jirabug:`PT-1575`: ``pt-mysql-summary`` did not print the PXC section for
  PXC 5.6 and 5.7
* :jirabug:`PT-1630`: ``pt-table-checksum`` had a regression which prevented it
  from working with Galera cluster
* :jirabug:`PT-1633`: ``pt-config-diff`` incorrectly parsed variables with
  numbers having K, M, G or T suffix (Thanks to Dieter Adriaenssens)
* :jirabug:`PT-1709`: ``pt-upgrade`` generated "Use of uninitialized value in
  concatenation (.) or string" error in case of invalid MySQL packets
* :jirabug:`PT-1720`: ``pt-pmp`` exited with an error in case of any unknown
  option in a common PT configuration file
* :jirabug:`PT-1728`: ``pt-table-checksum`` failed to scan small tables that
  get wiped out often
* :jirabug:`PT-1734`: ``pt-stalk`` did non-strict matching for "log_error",
  resulting in wider filtering
* :jirabug:`PT-1114`: ``pt-diskstats`` didn't work for newer Linux kernels
  starting from 4.18
